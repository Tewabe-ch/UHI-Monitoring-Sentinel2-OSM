This repository contains the code and methodology for the paper **"AI-Driven Urban Heat Island Monitoring: Multi-Source Data Fusion Using Sentinel-2 and OpenStreetMap"**. It presents a scalable framework to monitor and analyze Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects by fusing satellite imagery from Sentinel-2 with urban morphological data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and applying ensemble machine learning models.

## Abstract

Urban Heat Islands (UHI) represent a critical environmental challenge, exacerbated by rapid urbanization and climate change. This study proposes an AI-driven framework that fuses multi-source geospatial data to monitor and analyze UHI patterns at high spatial resolution. Ensemble machine learning models, including Random Forest and XGBoost, are employed to predict land surface temperature (LST) using urban morphological and vegetation features. Applied to Dublin, Ireland, the framework identifies temperature disparities of up to 7Â°C between dense urban centers and surrounding green spaces.
